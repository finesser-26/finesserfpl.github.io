                <h3 class="w3-text-blue w3-center">Preparing For Gameweek One</h3>
                <p>After a long period alas gameweek one is upon us. We almost always do not have the ideal team, always chopping and changing our drafts whenever we look at our team. If only  FPL would add a request more funds chip at the start of the season. I'll look at factors to lookout for when choosing your gameweek one team.</p>
                <h4 class="w3-text-blue">Team Structure</h4>
                <p>Getting your team structure right matters in every FPL season. Picking a team that is flexible is key. so start with a premium in each position excluding the goalkeepers, this gives you enough flexibility when chopping and changing your team. then find the right enablers the likes of Bailey (£5.0m), neto (£5.5m) with good fixtures to balance the rest of the team.</p>
                <h4 class="w3-text-blue">Fixtures</h4>
                <p>I'm a more fixtures inclined manager that's why I suggest planning ahead early in the season. I personally think you should plan with the first six gameweeks in mind and look to wildcard either GW 6, 8 or 9, because we'll be getting unlimited transfer during the <mark>World Cup</mark> between GW 16 and 17. We'll also have some fixture swings during that period.<br>Top five teams to target with amazing opening fixtures.</p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Arsenal</dt>
                    <dd>Arsenal only face Man Utd team from last season's top six</dd>
                    <dl>Man City</dl>
                    <dd>Man City do not face any team from last season's top six</dd>
                    <dl>Liverpool</dl>
                    <dd>Liverpool only face Man Utd from last season's top six</dd>
                    <dl>Leeds</dl>
                    <dd>Leeds only face Chelsea from last season's top six</dd>
                    <dl>Tottenham Hotspur</dl>
                    <dd>Spurs only face Chelsea from last season's top six</dd>
                </dl>
                <h4 class="w3-text-blue">Pre Season</h4>
                <p>Personally I don't look at pre season games, because they are matches meant regain match fitness so do not basically make decisions back of pre season only. Look at pre season games to get an overview of what a team are like and incase of a new manager look at their playing style, what eleven the manager is most likely to field on the pitch and how the mood is at the club etc.</p>
                <h4 class="w3-text-blue">Form</h4>
                <p>I'm more of a fixture than form manager but that might probably change over the course of the season. So I want the most form players in pre season to also have the fixtures before considering them. Here are some Form players during the pre season with amazing opening fixtures</p>

                <h4 class="w3-text-blue">Ownership</h4>
                <p>Finally I want to touch on the importance of owning players with very high EO. Don't try to be different so early in the season, go with the template. It wouldn't be so great to be playing catch up so early in the season. having atleast one or two differentials is enough at the beginning of the season.</p>

                <p>Here is my GW1 team to start the season with</p>
